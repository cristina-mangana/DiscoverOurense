    <string name="do_long_trekking_1">With a privileged location, a valley crossed by rivers and
        surrounded by hills, Ourense has natural landscapes of great beauty that are worth
        exploring, starting with its rivers. Walking the banks of the Minho means to discover a
        world of small animals and riverside forests where to get lost, going through paths that
        extend along its tributaries, kilometres and kilometres of nature.\n\nIf you want more, here
        you have an ideal base camp to discover a province where nature becomes legend: river Sil\'s
        canyons, Invernadoiro Natural Park, Baixa Limia-Gerés, the snowy mountains of Peña Trevinca,
        and so on.</string>
    <string name="do_long_thermal_2">The banks of river Minho constitute the city\'s great green
        artery: several kilometres of lush vegetation for walking, running or cycling while
        admiring nature and the landscape. In the most western section, after the Millennium Bridge,
        we find several springs of thermal water, many of them equipped for bathing.\n\nThe route
        begins on the right bank of the river, in the thermal area of A Chavasqueira, the closest
        one to the city. The path continues to O Tinteiro, and from there to the thermal area of ​​
        Muíño da Veiga with its four pools. A little further on, the Outariz Thermal Station offers
        beauty treatments, a sauna and two thermal circuits at very competitive prices. Also, the
        pools of Outariz and Burga de Canedo is the largest area of thermal activity in Ourense,
        which is also free.</string>
    <string name="do_long_rural_3">If you ascend to the areas of Cudeiro, Vilar, Palmés or Seixalbo,
        you will not only enjoy breathtaking views of the city of bridges, but you will also find
        rural villages that still retain their traditional architecture. In their ancient paths,
        camouflaged among the vegetation of the Ourense forest (halfway between the Atlantic and the
        Mediterranean forest), hiking and cycling routes are waiting for you, ideal to enter this
        green Ourense, a great unknown.</string>
    <string name="do_long_btt_4">Trails along the river, paths between forests, urban parks,
        panoramic viewpoints&#8230; get ready to ride your bike and discover spectacular landscapes
        surrounding the city.</string>
    <string name="do_long_theatre_5">Ourense is undoubtly a city related with arts. All over the
        year, you can assist to numerous theatre festivals, some of them are performed around the
        streets and some others take place in the Municipal Auditorium or the Principal Theatre.\n
        \nThe Principal Theatre is closely linked, in the memory of the city, to the traveling
        circuses that with their shows were the delight of young and old. One of the most famous in
        Ourense in the first decades of the 20th century was the Circo Feijóo, run by Secundino
        Feijóo, a native of Vilanova dos Infantes (Celanova). One of its main attractions was
        Mendoff, the tamer of the beasts, also captain of the cossacks, admired for his bravery and
        courage. One day a student asked Mendoff for his origins, and he replied, half in secret,
        that he was from Celanova, as his boss. But of course, it is more interesting to proclaim
        that the tamer was a fierce Russian.</string>
    <string name="do_long_music_6">Ourense has had few ambassadors as popular as Los Suaves, the
        legendary rock band led by brothers Yosi and Charly Domínguez. These musicians have always
        maintained a close relationship with the city, present in their songs, lyrics and disc
        covers, such as the legendary San Francisco Express. This feeling of rock spreads through
        Ourense\'s nightlife, in the area of \"Os Viños\". Here, a square bears their name.\n\n
        Following their school of rock, the city has seen the appearance of other historical bands,
        such as Megapearls, Mitocondrias or Cosecha Roja (today Burgas Beat). In the current
        scenario, we should highlight BestLife (UnderYourSeat), with a certain Anglo-Saxon
        influence, and Os Amigos dos Músicos, who play quality folk-pop and are regulars of Café
        Pop Torgal, a little café near the university area, in which are programmed first line
        acoustic concerts, as well as interesting seasons like the American Autumn. Especially
        active and punk-minded are the team in charge of El Pueblo, a venue for concerts on Hernán
        Cortés street, deep in the old city.\n\nFolk music has also played a significant role in the
        city\'s music scene, notably with band Mutenrohi. They were inspired from the rich Galician
        musical folklore that institutions such as the Royal Bagpipe Band or the Choir of Ruada have
        promoted for years. Mixing traditional music with other tropical sounds and rhythms, two
        unforgettable bands, Lamatumbá and O Sonoro Maxín, stood out for their anthems, essential in
        the festivals that flood Galicia every summer.</string>
    <string name="do_long_museums_7">Ourense has always had a special relationship with the world
        of arts and culture. At its most splendid moment, in the early 20th century, it came to be
        known as the \"Athens of Galicia\", the birthplace of the so-called Generation Nós, a group
        of intellectuals who led the renewal and modernization of Galician culture.\n\nThe epithet is
        not capricious; a very important list of writers, musicians and artists were very closely
        linked to the old Auria, having left their mark there.\n\nYou can enjoy some fabulous artistic
        works on the several museums located in the city.</string>
    <string name="do_long_routes_8">A different and healthy way of getting to know Ourense is to get
        out of its urban centre to discover its green belt, ideal for hiking. The gentle orography
        invites you to take long walks through landscapes and places of great natural, historical
        and ethnographic interest; trails, paths and tracks that will take you through magical
        places.</string>
    <string name="do_long_santiago_9">The Mozarabic Way is the longest Galician Jacobean Way:
        connecting Sevilla and Santiago de Compostela while extending an ancient Roman road that
        linked Merida with Astorga. The pilgrim that follows the old Via de la Plata takes the
        detour in Granja de la Moreruela (Zamora) up to A Gudiña, where there are two routes for
        Santiago (one going across Laza and the other across Verin) leading to Ourense.\n\nOurense
        receives the pilgrims in the rural village of Seixalbo, a set of ethnographic value still
        retaining its medieval trace. From there, the Way enters the city from the south, going
        through Zamora Avenue and Progreso Street to As Burgas, the hot springs which every pilgrim
        must visit since the Middle Ages.</string>
    <string name="do_long_catamaran_10">The Ribeira Sacra is the area north of the province around
        the banks of rivers Sil and Minho, known for its impressive natural wealth and heritage.
        Its name (meaning “Holy Riverbank”) comes from the Middle Ages, and has its origin in the
        number of monasteries that had been built in it, among which are San Esteban de Ribas de
        Sil, San Pedro de Rocas and Santa Cristina de Ribas de Sil. There is much to see, but above
        all you must visit river Sil’s canyons: from their viewpoints you can admire the spectacular
        landscape, and from a catamaran sailing the river you will appreciate their sheer
        monumentality.</string>
    <string name="do_long_train_11">From the Main Square, in the Historic Centre, A Chavasqueira
        thermal baths (the closest ones to the city centre) are just over two kilometres on foot;
        going there will take you a half hour. But if you want to get closer to Outariz and Burga de
        Canedo, the last pools of river Minho\'s Thermal Route, the distance increases to 7
        kilometres. The most comfortable alternative is to use the Thermal Train, which will take
        you to the thermal area of Outariz through the river lane, stopping at all the pools and
        crossing the arches of the Old Bridge, in a 30-minute trip in which you will enjoy the
        beautiful views of Ourense. </string>
    <string name="do_long_familiar_12">Comfortable, quiet, safe&#8230; and with lots of activities
        to have a great time! Ourense is undoubtedly a destination that will delight the travelers
        with family, with many proposals designed for the children of the house, enjoying the
        outdoors or learning about the history and customs of the city while having fun. And don’t
        forget a good dip in thermal water!\n\nIf you visit the city in a weekend, on Sunday you
        should go to Carrileiros Railroad Park, where you can enter the exciting world of trains and
        even riding on a scale locomotive. The venue has a circuit of almost 500 metres of railway
        where the trains circulate, in a route with all possible details.</string>
    <string name="do_long_entroido_13">A feast of subversion and good humour, the Entroido
        (Carnival) is a very traditional celebration in Ourense, as it kept being held despite
        prohibitions in past times. The province concentrates up to seven carnivals declared of
        tourist interest, making the capital the perfect starting point to discover them. If you
        visit the city in February, ypu must wear a disguise, otherwise, you risk to have to pay
        for rounds at the bars, and you have to taste the typical product of these dates, the
        ears.</string>
    <string name="do_long_maios_14">The feast of the nature par excellence, announcing the splendour
        of the flowers and the farewell of the cold winter. Of uncertain origin, this rite is
        celebrated since very remote times in several places of Galicia, although in Ourense it has
        remarkable and singular characteristics, besides being a local holiday. On the first Sunday
        of May, handmade sculptures of moss and flowers occupy the Alameda central promenade
        displaying traditional (pyramidal) or figurative shapes, always accompanied by songs:
        satirical verses on current issues that are traditionally sold in exchange for a
        tip.</string>
    <string name="do_long_magosto_15">The feast in honour of Saint Martin of Tours, patron of
        Ourense, announces the arrival of the popular Magostos, in which groups of friends and
        family gather around large bonfires to roast the first chestnuts and try the new wine. The
        party lasts all day and part of the night, always seasoned with roasted sausages, songs and
        a final toast with queimada, evoking ancient rites of purification. It is common to
        celebrate the Magostos in the mountains surrounding the city, especially Montealegre,
        although the urbanites can always go to the big bonfire that the City Council organizes in
        the Alameda Park. It is celebrated on November 11th.</string>
    <string name="do_long_samhain_16">The longest night of the year is celebrated in Ourense with a
        parade of pumpkins illuminated with candles through the streets of the Historic Centre.
        Although its best-known version is American Halloween, the truth is that Samhain is a feast
        of Celtic origins (in agricultural terms, the farewell of the long days of the summer) that
        in Galicia has been celebrated for centuries, although it was about to get lost. For some
        years in Ourense it has been celebrated with new forces, with workshops where girls and
        boys prepare the pumpkins with which they will then parade dressed as skeletons, ghosts,
        witches, etc. The celebrations extend all night and, as during Entroido, the disguises
        abound, as dark as possible.</string>
    <string name="do_long_festivities_17">Although Ourense does not celebrate its patron\'s feast
        until autumn, the Festivities take advantage of June\'s warmer weather and the celebration
        of Corpus Christi, a very traditional feast here. There are two weeks of festival in the
        city with non-stop activities: orchestras, concerts, parades, sports, children\'s activities
        and so on. The fireworks of its closing ceremony are indispensable, and for the most daring
        ones, the classic Ourense Rallye.</string>
    <string name="do_long_wine_18">There are few places in Europe with so many products with
        denomination of origin as Ourense. This is especially evident in the case of wine: four of
        the five denominations that exist in Galicia are found in this province. A very long
        tradition that has its roots in the Roman presence and the monasteries, and which was
        already referred by the medieval King Alfonso X the Wise who sang the delights of the \"good
        wine from Ourense\".</string>
    <string name="do_long_gastronomy_19">Ourense concentrates the best of the different gastronomic
        cultures in Galicia: from the coast it adopted the taste for the octopus, and from the
        inland the taste for meats and homegrown vegetables. Many of the most renowned products of
        Galician gastronomy are produced here, several of them protected with denominations of
        origin.</string>
    <string name="do_long_night_20">If there is a place in the city where people converge naturally,
        especially on weekend nights, it is certainly \"Os Viños\" in the Historic Centre, the tapas
        area par excellence of Ourense. This set of streets, united at one end by Blacksmiths\'
        Square and ending around the Cathedral, concentrates plenty of bars, restaurants and taverns
        where to enjoy the gastronomy and wine tradition of Ourense, sharing snacks, tapas and songs
        in good company. Although there are more and more proposals for a complete dinner and menu
        à la carte, the tradition is still to try some snacks at the foot of the bar making short
        stops: as tradition says, a snack per bar.</string>

    <string name="see_long_cathedral_1">The history of the Cathedral of Ourense is a journey of more
        than 8 centuries of construction and alterations that have shaped its structure: a temple of
        Latin cross with influences of Compostela and Cistercian art, made in late Romanesque style
        with notes of Gothic. Its elevation is usually dated between the 12th and 13th centuries and
        is one of the main monuments of the city, around which the streets of the historic centre
        are articulated.\n\nMonumental and majestic, Ourense\'s Cathedral still retains an air of the
        fortress that was in his past, which may be suspected from the towers and battlements of the
        southern facade. At the top stands out, for its spectacular height, the beautiful late
        Gothic dome, built in the 16th century.\n\nInside, with austere and elegant lines, the
        atmosphere of serenity and seclusion invites to walk around the ambulatory and its various
        chapels.\n\nIf we look closely to the northern gate, its authors have left a joke for
        posterity. We must find a character showing us his back. If we lower the view vertically
        from this figure to the ground we will see a small gap that remains curiously with water
        almost all year&#8230;</string>
    <string name="see_long_bridge_2">This Roman bridge is one of the historical landmarks of the
        city, linked to its origins. When it was built it was a strategic passage, the only point
        in many kilometres to cross river Minho. It was declared a Historic Monument in 1961. You
        must cross it while walking the Mozarabic Way – Via de la Plata to Santiago de Compostela.\n
        \nThe bridge also had a tower (appearing on the city\'s coat of arms) which was demolished
        in the 19th century. Attached to the old bridge, with which it forms a historic monument, is
        the chapel of Our Lady of Los Remedios.</string>
    <string name="see_long_burgas_3">You can not (or should not) leave Ourense without touching the
        water from these sources, one of the three “treasures” traditionally sung of the city: it
        comes from underground aquifers more than a kilometre deep and flows at +60°C. With these
        temperatures, it is not difficult to imagine the therapeutic uses which had over time. Its
        history dates back to the times of the Roman settlers.\n\nThis area is traditionally divided
        into three sections: the monumental fountain or \"Burga de Abaixo\"; the central esplanade,
        where the thermal pool is located; and the \"Burga de Arriba\".\n\nOn the lower level, you
        will find the recognizable silhouette of a Neoclassic fountain attributed to master Trillo.
        It consists of two side pipes and a pile carved with a finial in the centre, crowned by the
        coat of arms of the city. It was designed as a nymphaeum, a dwelling for nymphs, evoking the
        Roman past of the area which was already suspected back then. On one side is the
        \"Fervedoiro\", a square pond where you can see the water bubbling at boiling
        point.</string>
    <string name="see_long_main_square_4">For centuries, the Main Square has been the heart of the
        historic centre, and still is the main meeting point in the city. Bright, wide and arcaded,
        it is irregular in shape and has the distinction of being one of the few main squares in
        Europe with a slightly sloping floor.\n\nThe space is dominated by the facade of the City
        Hall, designed by Queralt, occupying the only side without arcades. Next to it stands the
        Old Bishop\'s Palace.\n\nThe other three sides are the arches that form the Promenade, a
        former lane for the aristrocracy reconverted nowadays into one of the downtown\'s liveliest
        areas with its terraces. Above it, the beautiful facades of noble houses from the 18th and
        19th centuries with tiles.</string>
    <string name="see_long_millennium_5">In 1998 the Old Bridge was definitively closed to car
        traffic. The following year the City Council laid the foundation stone of this bridge,
        which would be inaugurated on September 1st, 2001. Its opening meant not only a considerable
        relief to city traffic, but immediately became a symbol of contemporary Ourense, the moving
        city that overlooks the new millennium.\n\nA work of markedly avant-garde aesthetics, its
        was designed by architect Álvaro Varela. It features an unique elliptical shape, being
        especially curious its pedestrian walkway that rises 22 metres, leading to extraordinary
        viewpoints over river Minho.\n\nIts construction created a curious wave in the waters of
        river Minho, the Millennium Wave, which has since been used to water sports.</string>
    <string name="see_long_old_town_6">Manor pits, thermal springs, museums or large temples such as
        the cathedral, one of the best examples of Romanesque throughout the Iberian Peninsula, are
        some of the ingredients that make Ourense a small big beauty; all of this located in a short
        number of streets, conforming the historical centre of the city.</string>
    <string name="see_long_ferro_7">The Praza do Ferro is a crossroad more than a square, for that
        reason it is also named "Cruz de Ferro". Here, it was celebrated the market of the old
        blacksmiths, where were sold farm implements, pots and pans came from all over Galicia.\n\n
        It is formed by a square almost triangular, delimited in the west by the arcades and ancient
        buildings. Also, we can see the palace built in the 16th century by Don Juan Fernandez de
        Boan and Landecho.\n\nIn the center of the square there is a beautiful Renaissance fountain,
        which was originally located in San Esteban de Ribas de Sil Monastery. It has sirens at its
        base, caryatids, eros and two eagles crowning it.\n\nThis square is considered one of the
        Galician historical cultural nuclei, because here were born or lived writers and scholars
        like Vicente Risco, Otero Pedrayo, Florentino López Cuevillas, Xoaquín Lorenzo "Xocas" and
        Eduardo Blanco Amor.</string>
    <string name="see_long_eufemia_8">Originally belonging to a former Jesuit school, since 1767 it
        is part of the diocese as a parish church. Its facade, made by Brother Plácido Iglesias, is
        an archetype of Galician Baroque, combining sumptuousness, the use of curved lines and the
        play of light with the most typical details of Galician art: the use of granite, the giant
        order of columns, pinnacles or pediments with cross. Especially striking is its concave
        shape, a possible resource for greater monumentality despite the narrowness of the street,
        as St Euphemia’s Square is modern and subsequent to the church.\n\nThe interior, very
        austere, has a Latin cross floor with three longitudinal naves. A large Baroque altar presides
        over the church with the Christ of Hope in the centre.</string>
    <string name="see_long_praza_9">This market square is the most important market of the city, and
        well worth a visit for its peculiarity. The building itself was built in 1929, and has more
        palatial and stately atmosphere than market. The main access is done by a monumental
        staircase. Inside you can find all kinds of fresh food stalls, mainly cheeses and dairy,
        butchers and fishmongers.\n\nBut the most peculiar of this market is the exterior: Formerly
        it was surrounded by vineyards, but they were flooded in 1945 when the Barbaña river
        overflowed, so they disappeared and the land was filled. Since then, small buildings have
        been built there, known as the \"Rianxo\". The exterior of the market is perfectly
        classified by zones, depending on the products sold: Bakeries are all together in one area,
        florists in another, vegetables in another and so on.\n\nIt opens from Monday to Saturday
        from 8 to 15h.</string>
    <string name="see_long_cosme_10">Small square in the place known in the Middle Ages as
        «Arcade Fountain», the former site of one of the gates of the city.\n\nA fountain of modern
        construction stands out, topped by a sculpture of children\'s themes by Antonio Faílde. In
        one of its sides you may see the chapel that gives it its name: Saints Cosmas and Damian.
        This 16th-century building houses one of the most curious museums, the Arturo Baltar
        exhibition space and Baltar\'s nativity scene: over a hundred figures of clay that recreate
        traditional scenes of the Galician countryside and the Ourense of yore.</string>
    <string name="see_long_cloister_11">In the 14th century, after the fire that destroyed the first
        Franciscan convent in the city, the order moved to this place on the side of Montealegre
        Hill, where they remained until the 19th century. In 1843 the old convent was transformed
        into infantry headquarters (until its closure in 1984), producing numerous reforms. The most
        significant of them was the move of the apse and front of the church to St Lazarus\' Park,
        where it was rebuilt. The orphaned cloister can now be visited.\n\nDeclared a National
        Historic Monument in 1951, St Francis\' Cloister has outlived its eventful history retaining
        the beauty of its 63 arches virtually untouched, all of them decorated with motifs of
        plants, animals and humans. They are distributed around a seemingly square floor: neither
        side has the same number of arches, which are supported by double columns except the first
        four and last four in each row.\n\nIn the south side we may find the Chapel of the Venerable
        Third Order, today transformed into a hostel for pilgrims, and the exhibition space where
        part of the funds of the Provincial Archaeological Museum are shown. The set comes complete
        with St Francis\' Cemetery, located in the old convent\'s former orchard.</string>
    <string name="see_long_alameda_12">Of medieval origin, these gardens are nowadays one of the
        places that still retain the charm of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with superb
        examples of Modernist architecture. Crossed by Progreso street, its upper half is called
        Bishop Cesáreo\'s Gardens.\n\nFormer site for the councils, which were the neighborhood
        meetings where the public affairs of the medieval city were discussed, it was also the
        municipal orchard planted with olive trees. The aesthetic ideal of the powerful local
        bourgeoisie was felt in the works of the architects of the time, Daniel Vázquez Gulías and
        Manuel Conde among others.\n\nThe lower Alameda, in turn, stands on the river Barbaña, at
        the end of a tree-lined promenade where there is a female sculpture by Luís
        Borrajo.</string>
    <string name="see_long_posio_13">Enclosed urban park with unusual trees in these latitudes: it
        was originally a botanical garden, created in the mid-19th century by teachers from the
        neighbouring Otero Pedrayo Secondary School, who equipped it with trees and plants brought
        from the Botanical Garden in Madrid. The garden came to gather up to 200 species.\n\nIt is
        structured in three levels or terraces: the upper one (originally, the forest) stands out
        for its dense woodland and has a playground for children; the middle level is occupied by
        the traditional walk; and the bottom level is centered by a palm-lined promenade, a lush
        rose garden, a fountain and a pond. Surely we may find some peacocks in our journey.\n\nThe
        central promenade of these gardens is a traditional meeting place in the city; usually many
        of the concerts during the summer festivals are performed here. It also has a café with a
        terrace to rest in the shade of the banana trees.</string>
    <string name="see_long_santa_maria_14">Its facade, made in a restrained Baroque style, does not
        reveal the importance of this medieval church, located in the site of the previous cathedral
        of Ourense. The church was rebuilt in 1084 after its devastation, and again in 1772. It has
        three naves and three lanes framed by fluted pilasters. In the upper body, there are
        heraldic motifs, a pediment and two towers on the sides.\n\nThe church can\'t be understood
        without its monumental stairway, which connects the secluded Magdalene Square with the Main
        Square.\n\nInside, there is an altarpiece made of wood -in its natural colour- in
        Churrigueresque style. The statue of Holy Mary is taken out in procession on Holy Saturday
        and on Easter Sunday. This curious ritual evokes the conflicts that for years confronted the
        bishop and the municipal corporation in the city.\n\nThe current church was erected in 1722
        on the initiative of bishop Marcelino Siuri, who increased the stonework. This explains why
        the bishop\'s palace is at its side.</string>
    <string name="see_long_paradise_15">Located at the foot of the temple, the Gate of Paradise was
        built along the lines of Santiago. The sculpture set, one of the gems of the Ourense
        Cathedral, dazzles with its suggestive, almost hypnotic polychromy.\n\nThe statues in the
        columns reproduce the prophets. Among them, we may find Daniel with a friendly smile. Also
        the apostles with their books. The central arch retains the 24 elders of the Apocalypse,
        musicians carrying instruments from that time that seem to interact with each other in a
        lively talk.\n\nLeaning against the mullion there is a central statue of St. James. Above
        it, in a niche, we find a character on horseback, sword in hand. It is Saint Martin, patron
        of Ourense, who according to tradition in a winter day cut his cloak in half with his
        blade, offering it to a beggar.\n\nOn the walls, two anonymous paintings from the 18th
        century showing St Christopher and St Ildefonsus.</string>
    <string name="see_long_theatre_16">In the old street of shoemakers, Mr Santiago Sáez built a
        theatre. The year was 1830 and the new theatre was built in the fashion of the time, in
        Italian style, halfway between Baroque and Romanticism.\n\nCentre of Ourense\'s cultural
        life but also of the social and politic life, throughout its history the building underwent
        numerous transformations and refurbishments, such as that undertaken in 1915 to turn it into
        a cinema. In the 90s the city recovered this space after the major restoration which gave
        it its current design. Keeping the traditional elements, its dome incorporated frescoes by
        Xaime Quessada, and its design explains why the peanut gallery is called \"the paradise\"
        here.</string>
    <string name="see_long_auditorium_17">Opened in 2005, the Auditorium occupies a privileged
        space in the city. It was built by architect José Manuel Casabella, who designed and
        adapted it to the steep slope with a curvilinear path that respects the surrounding streets.
        \n\nIt is a versatile multipurpose space. It has three rooms and a two-floor underground
        parking. The lobbies are comfortably dimensioned to accommodate exhibitions and various
        cultural and social events.\n\nThey are well lit spaces with views over the city, through
        its glass facade.</string>
    <string name="see_long_sil_18">The Ribeira Sacra is an area that includes the banks of the
        rivers Cabe, Sil and Miño, in the south zone of the province of Lugo and the north of the
        province of Ourense. The Ribeira Sacra is especially known for its natural and biological
        treasures, constituting a vast ecosystem of great variety and richness. The Sil canyons
        stand out for their spectacular landscape. This is an area in which the river runs encased
        through landscapes and mountains that have been described as extremely beautiful.\n\nThe
        canyons have viewpoints enabled to admire its impressive monumentality, as well as a
        catamaran open to the public that crosses the canyons from one to the other side.\n\nThis
        place is also known for the quality of its wines. The vineyards, which can be seen along
        the course of the river, are arranged in a system of stone steps, called terraces, along
        the bank, and date back to Roman times.</string>
    <string name="see_long_pedro_19">In addition to the spectacular landscapes, the Ribeira Sacra
        is also known for its spiritual past. The toponym \"Ribeira Sacra\" could come from the
        Middle Ages . It was thought that the origin of its denomination would be in the Latin
        \"Rivoira Sacrata\", that could respond to the great amount of monasteries and temples
        located in the monumental Canyons and steep slopes that line the area. The ancient monks
        probably selected this place as their house due to the natural peace that can still be
        breathed nowadays.\n\nOne of the most remarkable monasteries of Ourense is St. Pedro de
        Rocas, located in the municipality of Esgos.</string>
    <string name="see_long_waterfalls_20">In Galicia, the water becomes art. One example of this are
        the beautiful landscapes created the rivers waterfalls. Located in the municipality of
        Silleda, you can find the spectacular Fervenza do Toxa.</string>
    <string name="see_long_castro_21">This archaeological site is essential to understand a
        fundamental part of the city\'s past. It combines historical values with natural ones,
        derived from a contour that not only retains a peculiar vegetation but enjoys a privileged
        location with stunning views over the city.\n\nFrom an archaeological perspective, Santomé
        stands out as one of the few examples in Spain where you can still see the coexistence, in
        time and space, of two very different cultures. In the highest part there are remains of a
        castro, a fortified settlement typical of the Celtic peoples of the Iron Age; in the plain,
        there is a customary Galician-Roman villa. Both date from the 1st century A.D., which shows
        how Roman modes and forms coexisted in perfect symbiosis with previous traditions, creating
        models that will survive long in rural Galicia.</string>
    <string name="see_long_velle_22">Although not strictly a bridge, the road through Velle\'s
        hydroelectric plant and its dam are a common crossing point of river Minho, for both
        vehicles and pedestrians. Its construction in 1963 allowed to connect the neighbourhoods of
        O Vinteun and A Lonia.\n\nAlthough it is only possible to cross the dam during daytime, it
        offers good views of the Velle waterfall. Its five water gates take the pushes of rivers
        Minho and Sil at the entrance of the city.\n\n300 meters upstream, the Velle bridge was built
        in 1992, connecting the roads of Santigo and Monforte de Lemos.</string>
